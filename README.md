https://datacup.ca/

### Bootstrap & Bonding
*June 26 - July 5*
* Contestants have until July 5th to create teams of up to 4 people. Desjardins employees who have not participated in the creation of the contest may participate. On the 26th, website registrations will open for teams and they may download and view the data as well.

### Compete & Compute
*June 26 - July 17*
* As of the 26th, contestants may start submitting their results on the Data Cup platform to get instant feedback on their models. The goal is to attain the highest possible prediction score. Submissions are limited to 2 per day. A real-time leaderboard will publicly display the scores of every team.

### Hustle & Pitch
*June 17 - July 24*
* On July 17th, the 5 best teams on the leaderboard will be selected to present to the jury on the finale. They will have 7 days to finish a slide deck detailing their solution and how they would go about implementing it. While the prediction score influences the winner, technical merit, methodology, operationalization and presentation all play a major role as well!
