# Desjardins Data Cup
https://datacup.ca/

> Best AUC (as of July 11) = ```0.892385802```

### Bootstrap & Bonding
*June 26 - July 5*
* Contestants have until July 5th to create teams of up to 4 people. Desjardins employees who have not participated in the creation of the contest may participate. On the 26th, website registrations will open for teams and they may download and view the data as well.

### Compete & Compute
*June 26 - July 17*
* As of the 26th, contestants may start submitting their results on the Data Cup platform to get instant feedback on their models. The goal is to attain the highest possible prediction score. Submissions are limited to 2 per day. A real-time leaderboard will publicly display the scores of every team.

### Hustle & Pitch
*July 17 - July 24*
* On July 17th, the 5 best teams on the leaderboard will be selected to present to the jury on the finale. They will have 7 days to finish a slide deck detailing their solution and how they would go about implementing it. While the prediction score influences the winner, technical merit, methodology, operationalization and presentation all play a major role as well!

> To better foster this dialogue around how data is used in businesses, Desjardins will be releasing an anonymized dataset and will encourage the community to explore it and extract insights from it. Participants will have 21 days to train the best predictive model to tackle a real-life scenario, just as data engineers, data scientists, developers and business analysts at Desjardins would have. The top 5 teams on the Data Cup scoring platform will have an additional 5 days to prepare a presentation for a jury consisting of industry experts from Desjardins and its partners.

> Data Cup is open to data aficionados from all backgrounds and demographics, whether they be students or industry professionals, subject matter experts or d3.js artists and to Desjardins employees as well (with some minor stipulations, see guidelines). We encourage you to bring your creative lightbulb moments, brainiest friends and your slickest ML tricks, you’re going to need it. All to show off your geek cred and lift the trophy at Desjardins’ first ever Data Cup!
